  The project consist in a recipe book single-page website developed with Angular (Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.) which allows us to be able to login, create a new user, manage our recipes, view them in detail and also to manage our shopping list, even push ingredients from a recipe directly to the shopping list.

  For the Db and deploy I used firebase, with which the website can be accessed here:
